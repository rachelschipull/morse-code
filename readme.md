# Morse Code Decoder for Dad

My dad's birthday is on Father's Day this year and I asked him what he wanted. He is a big HAM radio operator and always looking to improve his skills. He knew I was working on JavaScript apps, so asked me if I could build some that did the following:
1. Played a string of Morse code outloud - so he could listen and take it down
2. Allowed him to choose the length of the string.
3. Then showed him the solution so he could check his answer.

I think this app does meet those criteria, hopefully.

With a little more time, I'll add a media query or two to make it easier to use on mobile or a tablet, because I know my father loves his tablet.

I think the biggest take away from this project for me was learning how to use async await to play sounds inside a client-side app.

It was super fun to develop and I owe my success to some very helpful chatters on stream, including TowerMind and Rascal-Two... wherever you are.

Happy to hear ways I could make the code faster or cleaner, just send me a DM on Twitter: @SchipThatCode.

Thanks!
